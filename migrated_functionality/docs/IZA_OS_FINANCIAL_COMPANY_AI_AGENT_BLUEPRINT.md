## ✅ PART 4: "50-YEAR SENIOR FINANCIAL DESIGNER" RULES FOR AGENTS


**Embed these in prompts:**

> **Financial Rule #1**: If it's not secure, it's not designed.
> **Financial Rule #2**: Clarity beats cleverness. 'APY' → 'What You Earn'.
> **Financial Rule #3**: Trust is visual — badges, locks, real photos > stock.
> **Financial Rule #4**: Mobile isn't optional — 70% of finance users are on iPhone.
> **Financial Rule #5**: One missing disclaimer = lawsuit. One slow load = lost customer.
> **Financial Rule #6**: Every form needs "Save Draft" and "Undo" buttons.
> **Financial Rule #7**: Calculator widgets must update in real-time, not on submit.
> **Financial Rule #8**: Social proof numbers must be real and verifiable.
> **Financial Rule #9**: Dark mode isn't optional — it's accessibility.
> **Financial Rule #10**: Performance budget: LCP < 1s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1.
